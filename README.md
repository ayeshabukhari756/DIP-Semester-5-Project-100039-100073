**Roll Number:**
                 100039,100073.

**Course Name:**
              Digital Image Processing

**Project Description:**
                       This project focuses on enhancing the quality of color images using digital image processing techniques.
Color enhancement and sharpening methods are applied to improve visual clarity.
Python and OpenCV are used for implementation.
The results show clear improvement over the original image.

**Objectives:**
                Improve image clarity
                Enhance color quality
                Reduce blur using sharpening
                 Compare original and enhanced images

**Tools & Technologies Used:**
                             Python
                             OpenCV
                             NumPy
                             Matplotlib
                             Google Colab

**Steps to Run the Code:**
                          Open main.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
                          Install required libraries (if any)
                          Run all cells sequentially
                          View enhanced image and comparison results

**Sample Input and Output Images:**
                                    Original image, enhanced image, and side-by-side comparison are available in the Documentation folder.

**Conclusion:**
            The project successfully enhanced the color image by improving sharpness and color vibrancy.
The techniques used demonstrate the effectiveness of digital image processing methods in improving image quality.
